# PIC Stepper Motor Controller Application

A MikroElektronika PICusb stepper motor control project using a Pololu A4988 stepper motor controller.

This project is designed for a tiny development board from MikroElektronika 
, a [PICusb development board](http://www.mikroe.com/startusb/pic/), that
features a PIC 18F2550.
It is connected to a [Pololu A4988](https://www.pololu.com/product/1182) stepper motor
controller.
